**Project moving soon**

Google code is to stop all file downloads soon. Which means projects like this one will not be able to provide exe downloads.
I understand a lot of you download the binaries.
Thus I am forced to look for a new home for this project that allows hosting binaries.

The options I have at present are:
  * Github
  * CodePlex

If you have recommendations do send me a mail at nunespascal - at - gmail

Getting started:

You only need to tell reportsync the reportserver url of your ssrs server.
And give it a user credentials to log on to the server.

If you are not sure what your reports url is, you can find this in your Reporting Services Configuration Manager.
